# New Year Lights

## How does it work?

Just copy all files to your directory and type `npm install` in command line

Type in qoutes your IP or domen or just `localhost` (in this case you will be able see lights only on your computer)

Then type `npm start -- -srv <your IP adress or domen>` or just `npm start`, it will start on localhost
