# New Year Lights

This application synchronizes devices connected to one server and launches a colorful garland on them.

## How does it work?

Just copy all files to your directory and type `npm install` in command line

Then type `npm start -- -srv <your IP adress or domen>` or just `npm start`, it will start on localhost
